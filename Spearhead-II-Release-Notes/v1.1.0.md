## Balance Changes

### Officer Rework

- **Not all planned changes are complete yet.** For example, planned toggleable upgrades for officer abilities are not completed yet.
- All lower-tier officers (i.e. T1 and T2) no longer have any ability upgrades.
  - Officers all have one offensive and one defensive ability.
    - All officers for the same faction will share the same non-doctrinal (default) offensive and defensive abilities.
  - All abilities share cooldown for each officer, meaning that an officer cannot use both an offensive and defensive ability at the same time.
    - The death of an officer will result in any currently active ability being cancelled with no refund.
  - All officers are now of poor training unless they have a combat retinue, which would grant them the same training as standard line infantry for the faction.
    - T1 officers generally are the only squads with combat retinues.
- All officers now have only 1 weapon upgrade instead of 2 to reduce menu clutter.
- T1 officers will mostly have tactical support abilities, such as mortar barrages.
- T2 officers will mostly have longer cooldown, strategic support abilities, such as artillery strikes.
- Each officer requires the previous tier(s) to be called in.
  - For example, calling in a T3 officer requires both the T1 and T2 officers to have been called in at least once before.
- Officers have had various price changes to account for either that a squad is inside a command vehicle or adjusted unit skills.
