# v1.0.2.1 Release Notes

As always, no software is bug-free. If any bugs are encountered, please file a report on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6VeK5jhggB).

## Bugfixes

- (SS strosstruppen don't train) occurred because there was an attempt to train mod-only units from the SS T1 building, which failed. No gameplay reason, strictly internal modding reason.

### Soviet Union

- T-34 visual joke removed.

### Wehrmacht

- Volksgrenadiers now correctly fire StG 44s. If the visual effect of fully automatic fire of StG 44s proves unpopular, this change will be reverted and volksgrenadiers will fire K98s again.
