## Balance Changes

### Global

- All hedges/tree lines/groves line-of-sight behaviour reverted to vanilla behaviour; that is, if one cannot see through it with a unit, one cannot shoot through it.
  - However, if these same hedges/tree lines/groves are destroyed, not only can one see through it, one can also walk through or shoot through it.
