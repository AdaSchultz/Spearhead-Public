## Balance Changes

### Global

- Heavy calibre guns now deal deflection damage and have had their damage ranges tightened (less variance in damage output). Generally, smaller calibre (e.g. 50mm, 75mm) will deal less of their damage when deflected.
  - American 75mm armour-piercing rounds deal 2% deflection damage.
  - American 76mm armour-piercing rounds deal 4% deflection damage.
  - American 90mm armour-piercing rounds deal 8% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 385-635 to 520-550, guaranteeing one-shots of medium tanks.
  - Axis low-velocity 75mm armour-piercing rounds deal 2% deflection damage.
  - Axis medium-velocity 75mm armour-piercing rounds deal 4% deflection damage.
  - Axis high-velocity 75mm armour-piercing rounds deal 6% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 225-375 to 320-350.
  - Axis 88mm armour-piercing rounds deal 8% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 415-690 to 500-530, guaranteeing one-shots of medium tanks.

  - British OQF 75mm rounds deal 2% deflection damage.
  - British 17-pounder rounds deal 6% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 300-500 to 400-430.

  - **Soviet 85mm armour-piercing rounds deal 8% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 385-585 to 530-560, guaranteeing one-shots of medium tanks.**
    - This change may result in adjustments for T-34-85 tanks if this damage improvement proves too overpowered.
  - Soviet 100mm armour-piercing rounds deal 12% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 450-750 to 650-680, guaranteeing one-shots of heavy medium tanks.
  - Soviet 152mm armour-piercing rounds deal 15% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 635-1060 to 850-880, guaranteeing one-shots of some heavy tanks.
  - Soviet 122mm armour-piercing rounds deal 16% deflection damage. Damage range tightened from 555-925 to 720-750, guaranteeing one-shots of heavy medium tanks.

  - Some abilities had higher ranges than others for some reason, such as Panther HE and IS-2 HE.
- All toggle high-explosive rounds range reduced from 75 (standard tank gun range) to 60 (standard HE ability range).

- Flares can no longer detect camouflaged units, but they still grant line of sight.
- Rocket artillery damage radius slightly increased per rocket.

- Land mine accuracy increased.
- All "Mark Vehicle" and vehicle-directed "Mark Target" abilities have been unified in effect and cost, though not necessarily in description.

  - All Mark Vehicle/Target abilities cost either 30 munitions or 40 munitions depending on whether the ability only grants a slight debuff to the target vehicle or if it also sends a plane for reconnaisance, respectively.
