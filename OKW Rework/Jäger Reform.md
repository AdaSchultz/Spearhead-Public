Jäger, the doctrine nobody really understands what's supposed to be done with it.

## Global Changes
More tools to provide Jäger with a slight edge in ambushing and getting into position

### 1. [Global] (PASSIVE) Extra Camo Netting
  - "With enough camo netting and plenty of radio discipline, our enemy will find us hard to locate until its too late."
     - Allows ability to upgrade command structures & bunkers with camouflage (50 Muni)

### 2. [Global] (PASSIVE) Poor Visibility Conditions
  - “Utilizing the harsh weather, we are able to be harder to detect to the enemy, and with the right timing and technique, we can sneak past enemy lines without detection”
    - With 3cp/4cp, squads can camo whilst out of combat and standing still, able hold fire. When T3 is unlocked, units can upgrade camo walk
### 3. [Global] (PASSIVE) Gebirgsjäger Training
  - “The harsh and specific training regimen to the Gebirgsjäger meant they could perform well in the rugged mountain terrain, and be in peak shape.”
    - Squads sprint when out of combat, are immune to cold effects, move normally through snow, and have increased line of sight(?)
