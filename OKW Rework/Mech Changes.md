Mech is being redesinged to bring it into a more Mechanized Breakthrough role, rather than a weird Elastic Defense.


## Upgrade Changes
Global Buffs that help the doctrine stand out more
  - Sturmpioneers gain HE Granatbuchse instead of Panzerbuchse 39
  - Global 1 "Aufklärungsgruppe"
      - Description: "Our mobile reconnisance forces are some of the best, and can take advantage of their manueverability to disrupt the enemy."
      - Light Vehicles gain the ability to cap and increase Line of Sight


  - Global 2 “Panzer IV Ausf. H Requisition"
      - Description: “Put in a request to the OKH in order to get Panzer IVs with electric turret drives”
      - Cost: 45 Fuel, 100 Manpower
      - Effect: All Panzer IV Js on field become Panzer IV Hs, all Panzer IVs after that are the H Variant with electric turret drive

  - Removal of the slower cap/decap speed from all units.

## Infantry Changes
SS Mech is being granted an extra squad, and tweaks to the doctrinal squads
  - Kampfgruppe Grabner Panzergrenadiere
      - Description: A recon detachment from the 9th SS, the men under Grabner found themselves fighting to retake Arnhem from the British paratroopers. Despite the element of surprise, this unit suffered heavy losses during the initial engagement.

      - Skill: Experienced
      - Role: Force Recon

      - Upgrades: x2 STG44, x2 G43 (Zf4), Rifle Grenade, Smoke Rifle Grenade, Panzerfaust 100 (Panzerfaust with global)

And the doctrinal squad changes are as follows:
1. 9th SS Grenadiere
      - Description: The 9th SS primarily recruited from the RAD, an organization designed to provide logistical support and create fortifications. As a result, these men had a finer understanding for engineering that kept Panzers rolling

      - Skill: Regular
      - Role: Frontline
      - Base Kit: M24 Grenade, Smoke Grenade, Rudimentary Repair

2. 10th SS Panzergrenadier
      - Description: Despite being inexperienced, the Panzergrenadiers of the 10th did their best to distinguish themselves, from relieving troops caught in Army Group South, to stalling and parrying the Americans and British in the Netherlands.
      - Armaments: G43, MP40
      - Skill: Experienced
      - Role: Combined Arms
      - Base Kit: M24 Grenade, Smoke Grenade, Panzerwurfmine
      - Upgrades:  Flammenwerfer 41, x4 MP40, x2 ZK 383, Bundle Grenade, Panzerfaust 100
## Vehicle Changes
To stand out from its Wehrmacht Counterpart, taking the approach of a Mechanized Breakthrough via heavy tanks seemed the most sound.
 1. SS Mech gains buildable Tiger Tanks
 2. Tiger Ace Reworked
  - Description: Crewed by season veterans of the Eastern Front, this ace crew is led by an experienced commander who knows how to effectively dispatch of any armored or infantry threat that they come across.
      - Ace now defined by different “Ace Crew” and the bonuses are as follows:
          - Ace Driver (Stock), Tiger Ace has better accel, decel & comes with Blitzkrieg Tactics
          - Ace Gunner (100/150 MP, 15 Fuel): Better Accuracy, can fire a Target Weakpoint Shot
          - Ace Commander (100/150 MP, 15 Fuel): Better Line of Sight
          - Ace Loader (100/150 MP, 15 Fuel): Increased Reload Speed, Reduced Cooldown of Special Ammo (HE, APCR/Aimed Weakpoint)
