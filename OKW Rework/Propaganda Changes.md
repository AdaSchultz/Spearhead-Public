Currently, Prop suffers from a weird mix of Mechanized and Defensive equipment. This intends to push them to the Defensive, at the cost of the Mechanized Equipment they once had.

## Global Changes
A new set of globals for Propaganda to play with.

### 1. [Global] (PASSIVE) Nero Decree
- “The enemy advances closer and closer to the Fatherland, ensure they inherit nothing but rubble.”
    - Volkssturm gain the ability to build Wooden Barricades (Weak green cover), Roadblocks, Schu-Mines and Barbed Wire defenses from Mech, along with being able to booby trap both buildings and capture points.
### 2. [Global] (PASSIVE) Advanced Minelaying
- “Mines are more expendable than manpower this late in the war. We have figured out how to make the most of them to cause confusion in our enemy whilst maximizing effectiveness”
    - Gains access to Tellermine Field (Uses S-Minefield signs, punishes players who just drive over S-minefields by faking them out) and False Minefield (Lays a dummy mine that visually looks like a minefield. Does no damage, more of a psychological tool)
 3. Propaganda gains the MG42 Pillbox from Mech, potentially the Mortar Bunker.

## Upgrade Changes

## Thematic Changes
Sturmgrens, Officers and the Volkssturm Panzerjager are being touched upon
  - Sturmgrenadier:
      - Name: 32. SS ‘30 Januar’ Sturmgrenadiere
      - Description: Raised as a Grenadier division in 1944, the division drew manpower from training schools, Hungarians, Romanians and small units to fill out its ranks. Upon completing its training, the division was sent to fight along the Oder River to stem the tide of the Red Army, being pushed back until ending up in the defense of Berlin.
  - Volkssturm Panzerjager:
      - Name: Hitlerjugend Panzerjager
      - Description: Young, spry and nimble, these indoctrinated children traded pencils and school lessons for Panzerfausts and pistols to take out advancing enemy armor, displaying the peak of Germany’s desperate situation.
   
  - T1 Officer:
      - Name: SS-Junkerschule Cadets
      - Description: Various SS NCO Cadets, pulled from the schools to gain combat experience and lead units in combat. Well motivated and equipped for the task at hand, they ensured orders were carried out however they must.
  - T2 Officer:
      - Name: SS-Junkerschule Instructors
      - Description: Raised from various training schools, with experience fighting and commanding on various different fronts, the SS-Junkerschule was key in making proper officers for the various Waffen-SS divisions until the very end of the war, even being drawn upon to make up for officer shortages.
  - T3 Officer:
      - Description: Military Governors who took orders from both High Command and Hitler himself, these men were placed in charge of organizing Volkssturm Units and enacting Scorched Earth Policy. Whilst most were die-hard fanatics, others refused to carry out these orders as the war went on.

## Officer Changes
Changing of a singular barrage
1. Registered Flak 8.8cm Barrage
   - Works the same as Registered Artillery, but deals more damage to armor than it does to infantry
