### Thematic Changes
Various descriptions were determined to be a bit much. Other changes include a thematic one
  - T1 Officer:
      - Description: The 2nd SS can trace its origins back to the SS-VT’s Germania Regiment, engaged in offensive action through the low countries and France. Upon proper divisional formation, this unit turned East, leading to Moscow.
  - T2 Officer:
      - Description: The 2nd SS would proceed to take part in Operation Zitadelle. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to break the Red Army, and would be shipped off to France for their next refit into a Panzer Division.
  - T3 Officer:
      - Description: Das Reich would continue to be used as an aggressive force, from trying to break out of the Falaise Pocket, to the Battle of the Bulge. Their last string of failed offensives ended with Operation Spring Awakening, an attempt to relieve Budapest.

  - Stoßtrupp:
      - Description: Stormtrooper tactics were not a new concept by any means, dating back to the First World War. SS Panzer Divisions made good use of these detachments like their Soviet counterparts, and were often armed with large quantities of automatics 
  - Panzergrenadier:
      - Description: Panzergrenadiers of the 2nd SS had become accustomed to fighting alongside their panzers in various major offensives, and were quite formidable in combined arms warfare. These squads were able to support tanks in their breakthroughs.
  - Sturmgrenadier:
      - Description: Infantry of Das Reich were seasoned veterans of the Eastern Front, specifically at Kursk, earning the nickname of ‘Front Swine’ given their fighting in the muddy steppes of the Soviet Union. These lessons allowed them to train recruits up to par before being baptized in combat.
  - Grenadier:
Instead of the Wallonians, the Grenadier squad is seeing a complete facelift
      -   Name Change: 33. SS-Sturmbrigade Charlemagne Grenadiere
      -   Description: With the dissolution of the LVF and Sturmbrigade Frankreich, the 33rd SS was born from their combined ashes. The indoctrinated men of the 33rd proved themselves capable, launching local counterattacks against the Red Army, until the bitter end in the Reichstag.
