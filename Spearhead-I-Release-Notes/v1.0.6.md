# v1.0.6 Release Notes

Added a default French translation to be replaced with future inputs from the French translation team.

Fixes the following bugs:

- [#50 - Wehrmacht's Panzer doc Signal Relay](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/50)
- [#51 - Salvage operations malfunction](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/51)
- [#75 - Soviet officer multiple illumination barrage](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/75)
- [#76 - AT grenade bug for Conscripts](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/76)
- [#92 - Squad getting 4x MP40 and another weapon](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/92)
- [#103 - Sdkfz 250 smoke screen with no cooldown](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/103)
- [#104 - SS Propaganda "Unit Training" not working](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/104)
- An unreported bug where "Tank Shock" could be used on any squad, whether suppressed or not.
- An unreported bug where the SS-Aufklärer unit shared the same hotkey as SS-Sturmgrenadiere (both were mapped to "S"); SS-Aufklärer is now mapped to "U".
- An unreported bug where the KV-1 was advertised as receiving +20% armour when upgraded to KV-1E variant; the label now reflects that the KV-1 actually receives +30% armour.

Some issues with Salvage still remain; future patches will fix those problems eventually.
