# v1.0.4 Release Notes

Fixes the following bugs:

- [#26 - Wehrmacht Fallschirmjäger air supply ability does not provide correct objects](https://github.com/Stoklomolvi/Spearhead-Public/issues/26)
- An unreported bug where the T2 Fallschirmjäger officer is able to call in butterfly bombs without cooldown as cooldown was tracked per entity in the squad, rather than the squad itself.
