- An unreported bug where the Ambush ability upgrade on SS Tiger I tanks would never be available.
- An unreported bug where Soviet Shock doctrine team weapon armour upgrades would have no effect. As the OB-25 76mm artillery piece had a full upgrade list, I gave them the upgrade for free (since it's a Soviet Shock unique unit, anyway).
- Some overlapping cooldown bugs.
