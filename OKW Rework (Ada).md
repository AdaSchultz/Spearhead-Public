# v1.4 "OKW Plan"

## Overview

The OKW/SS Faction as a whole are in a strange place. From doctrines such as Jäger not being worth picking at all, others being weirdly designed around a certain theme and leaving the faction feeling bare. The intent behind these changes is to bring each doctrine into their own unique light without bleeding into the other doctrines too heavily.

The Short of these Changes are as follows:

1. Restructure of Propaganda, Mechanized and Jäger to bring them into proper roles
- i.e, Mechanized into a more Mobile, Combined Arms focus. Propaganda into a defensive doctrine, Jäger into its own thing
2. Tweaks to Panzerjäger, Panzer & Sturm to cement their roles and increase uniqueness compared to Wehr Counterparts.
- i.e, Bringing Panzerjäger's Anti-Infantry capabilities back to a reasonable amount, Sturm receiving changes to upgrades
3. Various description changes to units that otherwise seemed misleading or attempting to glorify these units more than they deserve
